# CatFood UI
Is your cat overweight? Are you tired of wondering if your cat has already been fedâ€”if their famished cries are genuine or simple manipulation? Well wonder no more. This meal tracker makes communication between family members easy. With internet access and an easy to use physical interface, the mystery is taken out of mealtime.  

## Webpage
CatFood runs on LAMP and allows easy access from any device on the local network. Additionally, saving the site to the home page on iPhone offers an application-like experience for even more simplicity.
