# CatFood UI
Is your cat overweight? Are you tired of wondering if your cat has already been fedâ€”if their famished cries are genuine or simple manipulation? Well wonder no more. This meal tracker makes communication between family members easy. With internet access and an easy to use physical interface, the mystery is taken out of mealtime.  

## Physical Interface
To make mealtime tracking effortless, a physical interface can be used to interact with the database.
