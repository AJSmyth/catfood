# CatFood UI
Is your cat overweight? Are you tired of wondering if your cat has already been fedâ€”if their famished cries are genuine or simple manipulation? Wonder no more. This meal tracker makes communication between family members/housemates easy through internet access and an easy to use physical interface.
